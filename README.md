How to add wocommerce cart to wordpress menu

First get a cart image to use. I used cart.svg
Upload it to your images.

Second, add the code to header.php

create a menu item with custom link "#", it doesnt matter what the name of the item. 
Whats important is to add a class "cart-menu" to that menu item.

This code works setting is turned to redirection to cart after a product is added to cart.
